# Tweeter Project
Hey there! I am Alex! This is my attempt at Twitter! 

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

In this project I put in practice HTML, CSS, JS, jQuert, AJAX and I think it tourned out pretty cool!


## Getting Started

1. Clone your repository onto your local device.
2. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Dependencies

- Express
- Node 5.10.x or above
